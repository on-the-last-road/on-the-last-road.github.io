title:  The miners, the serpent and the dead orcs (Game 12)
---

## Résumé de Ogk
- we gathered info
    - I talked to the other miners
    - The elves "éplucha des tonnes de patates", hahahaha
    - THukgrel talked to the "court dwarves"
- Serpent tongue gave raw gold to a guard 
- the guard had to deliver the gold to someone
- Thugrel pickpocketed the guard and stole the gold
- we followed the guard
- he was talking to 5 orcs!
- he had the gold no more, so the orcs slained him (by a spear)
- We, the dwarves, created a shield wall on the bridge so the orcs would not pass!
- We killed all of them!
- The villagers were looking at the scene and were extremely happy!
- Once again, we saved the day!
- ...
- En allant revoir serpent tongue, il nous dit qu'on vient de condamner le village car il va tous nous tuer... le spectre!
- On l'a assomé a grand poings de nains!
