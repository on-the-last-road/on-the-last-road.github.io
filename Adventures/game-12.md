title:  The miners, the serpents and the dead orcs (Game 12)
---

- we gathered info
    - I talked to the other miners
    - The elfes "Ã©plucha des tonnes de patate", hahahaha
    - THukgrel talked to the "court dwarves"
- Serpent tongue, gave raw gold to a guard 
- the guard had to deliver the gold to someone
- Thugrel pick poketed the guard and stole the gold
- we followed the guard
- he was talking to 5 orcs!
- he had the gold no more, so the orcs slained him (thrusted by a spear)
- We, the dwarves, created a shild wall on the bridge so the orcs would not pass!
- We killed all of them!
- The villagers were looking at the scene and were extremely happy!
- Once again, we saved the day!
